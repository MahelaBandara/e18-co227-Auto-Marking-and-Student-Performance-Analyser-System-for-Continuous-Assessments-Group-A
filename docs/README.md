## Introduction


 The Department of Computer Engineering uses many coding based assignments for continuous assessment of student learning. The instructors have to spend a lot of time manually marking these assignments which is not the ideal use of the instructorsâ€™ time. Therefore, we build a system for auto marking coding assignments. 
This system supports automated recording and analysis of student performance. It shows how that particular student progressed with their assignments and what are the strengths and weaknesses of that student.
