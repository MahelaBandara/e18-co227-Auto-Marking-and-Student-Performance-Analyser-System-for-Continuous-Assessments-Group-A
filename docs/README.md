## Introduction


 The Department of Computer Engineering uses many coding based assignments for continuous assessment of student learning. The instructors have to spend a lot of time manually marking these assignments which is not the ideal use of the instructorsâ€™ time. Therefore, we build a system for auto marking coding assignments. 
This system supports automated recording and analysis of student performance. It shows how that particular student progressed with their assignments and what are the strengths and weaknesses of that student.

## Phase I - Auto Marking System for Coding Assessments

#### Appication Content
- User friendly Web Interface for instructors to mark the assignments
- Auto marking processed with GitHub Classroom
- User can create courses, assignments and add students according to their preference
- Finally instructor can view the marks of the each student






## Phase II - Student Performance Analyser

#### Appication Content
- User friendly Web Interface for instructors to analyse student performance
- Using this web interface user can easily identify the progress of each student with the assignments
- Student can identify their strengths and weeknesses
